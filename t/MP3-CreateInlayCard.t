# Tests for MP3::CreateInlayCard
#
# $Id$

# Before `make install' is performed this script should be runnable with
# `make test'. After `make install' it should work as `perl MP3-CreateInlayCard.t'

# To test comprehensively, there's a set of test MP3 files supplied, so that
# we can check for correct behaviour across a range of sets of MP3s, some
# multi-artist, some multi-album, some multi-artist *and* multi-album.
# Perhaps overkill, but good to be thorough.
